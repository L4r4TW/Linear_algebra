## Problem

What is currently painful/fragile/duplicated?

## Proposed change

What should the structure look like after?

## Why now?

Why is this worth doing now (blocks features, causes bugs, etc.)?

## Risks

What could break?

## Done when

- [ ] Behavior unchanged
- [ ] Code is simpler/cleaner
- [ ] Build passes
- [ ] Smoke test done
